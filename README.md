Hello, I'm [Richard Yeboah]
I love to play with data

I build intelligent systems that solve real-world problems using Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and data-driven automation.
My work focuses on building scalable models, end-to-end ML pipelines, and AI-powered tools that streamline complex workflows.
I enjoy transforming raw data into insights, predictive models, and production-ready AI applications.

🔹 Experienced in Python, SQL, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch
🔹 Strong background in data analysis, feature engineering, and model optimization
🔹 Interested in AI automation, financial modeling, and real-time analytics
🔹 Passionate about building software that replaces repetitive tasks with smart automation
🔹 Always learning, experimenting, and improving with every project
